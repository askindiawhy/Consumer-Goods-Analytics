# Consumer-Goods-Analytics

This is Challenge 4, organized by Codebasics and Atliq Technologies, within the consumer goods domain.

**PROJECT OVERVIEW **

This repository includes the code and SQL queries for the Consumer Goods domain of the Data Analytics Bootcamp at Codebasics. In this project, I will analyze a dataset related to consumer goods, aiming to address ten specific ad hoc requests using SQL queries. The data comes from "AtliQ Hardwares," a leading hardware company that specializes in PCs, printers, mice, and computers with a global presence.
